	<h1> Margiela SS24 John Galliano’s Artisanal 
</h1>
<body> John gallionno’s collection for the ss24 margiela couture show was one of the most memorable shows in fashion in recent times. The clothes inspired by galliono’s own designs paired with makeup by legendary artist Pat McGrath looks, detailed set, and performances by the models made it one of the most talked about shows in fashion this season. I'd like to do this topic and deep dive into the concept of Galliano’s designs, pat mcgraths makeup looks and techniques, the set design, the model’s performance, how it all came together, and the contreveries behind the collection.

<h1>Book making</h1>

<body>I love to design for print and I love the smell of new books so for this topic I would like to go over different book binding methods and results. I think a good place to start would be with the history of print. The history of print dates back to japanese ukiyo-e prints which later inspired the printing press. Another section could be the different kinds of binding techniques like perfect binding, coptic binding etc. Another section can be methods used today and the evolution of the process.

<h1>Gold </h1>

<body>I know little about gold but it’s a big part of my culture and family. My mom made gold jewlery by hand and sold gold for many years. It's a precious metal worth alot and can be formed into many things. I'd go over what gold is and some facts about the metal. Another area would cover the market and its value. Another area would cover old gold tecnqiues and another would cover the new techniques. Last I would go over different purity of gold and designs with each. </body>
